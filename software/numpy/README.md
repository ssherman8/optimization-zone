# Intel® Optimized NumPy With oneMKL

This guide describes how to get optimal NumPy performance on Intel® processors, from servers to laptops, by using Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) as the backend for linear algebra, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), random number generation, and vectorized math. It covers installation, how to activate each optimization with minimal code changes, thread and NUMA tuning, and how to verify that oneMKL is active, along with measured benchmark results.

## NumPy Performance Contributors

NumPy runs much of its work in its own compiled code, but its heaviest numerical kernels are handed off to external libraries: linear algebra to a BLAS/LAPACK library, FFTs to an FFT library, and large element-wise transcendental math (`sin`, `exp`, `log`) to vectorized loops. For those kernels, performance is largely decided by *which* native library the call lands in.

That backend is a choice made at install time. PyPI and conda-forge NumPy ship with OpenBLAS, a strong general-purpose implementation that uses AVX-512 on recent Intel CPUs. oneMKL goes further in two ways: its kernels are tuned for Intel hardware, and it accelerates a number of functionalities not covered by a BLAS library such as FFT, random number generation, and vectorized math.

## Accelerating NumPy With oneMKL

Pointing NumPy at Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) turns the tuned Intel kernels into wall-clock speedup with no change to your NumPy code. Across a representative set of NumPy-heavy workloads this is a 3.95x geomean speedup at one socket; the full breakdown is in [Benchmark results](#benchmark-results).

The speedup arrives in two parts that activate differently, and the distinction matters for the rest of this guide:

- **Linear algebra (BLAS and LAPACK)** turns on automatically once oneMKL is the backend (details for this in the [installation](#installation) section). `np.dot`, `np.matmul`, and `np.linalg.*` route to it with no code change.
- **FFT, random, and vectorized math** come from three separate packages ([`mkl_fft`](https://github.com/IntelPython/mkl_fft), [`mkl_random`](https://github.com/IntelPython/mkl_random), [`mkl_umath`](https://github.com/IntelPython/mkl_umath)). These do not activate on import; you switch them on explicitly in code.

> **Packaging note.** Explicit activation applies to the current packaging ([Intel® Distribution for Python](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/distribution-for-python.html) 2026.0 and later), which installs standard NumPy and layers oneMKL underneath. Releases up to 2025.3.0 shipped an Intel-built NumPy that activated [`mkl_fft`](https://github.com/IntelPython/mkl_fft) and [`mkl_umath`](https://github.com/IntelPython/mkl_umath) on import, and their older extensions lack the `patch_*` functions used below. On an older release, see [Key considerations](#key-considerations) before adding activation calls.

### Installation

There are two practical ways to get a oneMKL-backed NumPy. conda is recommended because it also lets you control the OpenMP runtime (see [Threads and NUMA](#threads-and-numa)). [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) distribution is recommended.

**conda.** A single command installs NumPy, SciPy, the three extension packages (mkl_fft, mkl_random, mkl_umath), and the runtime libraries. The BLAS/LAPACK backend routes to oneMKL automatically; the extensions are installed but still need explicit activation (the activation process is shown in the [Optimization Levers](#optimization-levers) section).

```bash
conda create -n idp_env python intelpython3_full \
  -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda \
  -c conda-forge --override-channels && \
  conda activate idp_env
```

> **Threading layer for this environment.** `intelpython3_full` is a metapackage that also brings in `scikit-learn`, which is built against GNU OpenMP. In this mixed environment set `MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU` so oneMKL and those packages share one OpenMP runtime (see [Threads and NUMA](#threads-and-numa)). If you only need oneMKL-backed NumPy, prefer the targeted install below, which stays on Intel OpenMP (`MKL_THREADING_LAYER=INTEL`) with no such tradeoff.

Pin python version to match your project if you need a specific interpreter. NumPy comes from conda-forge; the Intel channel supplies Intel's latest oneMKL builds. The `mkl_fft`/`mkl_random`/`mkl_umath` extensions are available from both conda-forge and the Intel channel, so either channel works for them; the command below keeps both channels enabled. To add oneMKL to an *existing* environment that already has conda-forge NumPy installed, swap its BLAS to the MKL variant and add the extensions in place (this re-links the NumPy you already have, it does not reinstall NumPy).

_Note: Intel-channel packages are built to be compatible with conda-forge but not with the Anaconda defaults channel._

```bash
conda install \
  -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda \
  -c conda-forge --override-channels \
  "blas=*=*_intelmkl" \
  mkl mkl_fft mkl_random mkl_umath mkl-service
```

`--override-channels` flag limits package resolution to Intel + conda-forge and avoids the higher-priority Anaconda defaults channel and other user-defined channels in the condarc file. The `blas=*=*_intelmkl` selector requests the Intel channel's MKL-backed runtimes `libblas`, `libcblas`, `liblapack`, and `liblapacke`; conda-forge offers an equivalent under the build string `blas=*=*mkl*`. Either gives an MKL BLAS backend. The extensions (`mkl_fft`/`mkl_random`/`mkl_umath`) are published on both channels. Because the Intel channel is listed first, conda prefers it for these packages (set `channel_priority: strict` if you want that ordering enforced rather than just preferred), which is what you want for Intel's latest oneMKL builds; conda-forge also carries them if you prefer that source.

**pip.** Intel publishes NumPy and SciPy wheels already linked against oneMKL, plus the three extensions, on a public wheel repository. The `--index-url` below points pip at that repository's PyPI-compatible index API. There is no symlink to swap; the wheels arrive pre-linked.

```bash
pip install --index-url https://software.repos.intel.com/python/pypi \
  numpy scipy mkl_fft mkl_random mkl_umath mkl-service
```

Use `--index-url`, not `--extra-index-url`: Intel's index is a partial mirror, and with `--extra-index-url` pip would see PyPI's higher-numbered OpenBLAS wheel and install that instead. Packages Intel does not mirror (for example `threadpoolctl`, used for [verification](#verifying-onemkl-is-active)) install normally from PyPI in a separate step. The Intel wheels target Linux and Windows; if `pip` reports no matching distribution, check that your platform and Python version are covered on the index.

Whichever path you take, choose the OpenMP threading layer and set it **before anything imports NumPy, SciPy or MKL**. The variable is read once at MKL load time, so exporting it after the import has no effect. Intel OpenMP is the fastest on Intel hardware and is oneMKL's default, so setting the variable explicitly documents intent and guarantees the choice rather than changing behavior, especially useful in an all-Intel environment where Intel OpenMP is the only runtime present. In a mixed environment where other packages bring GNU's `libgomp`, you may instead set `MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU` so the process shares one runtime; that tradeoff and the other layer values are detailed under [Threads and NUMA](#threads-and-numa):

```bash
export MKL_THREADING_LAYER=INTEL   # Intel OpenMP (libiomp5): oneMKL's default; set explicitly to lock it in
```

## Optimization Levers

Each subsection below is one lever: what it accelerates, when it is worth using, and how to switch it on. The first is automatic; the rest are explicit.

The three explicit extensions share an activation model, and the key point is how little code it takes. Activation is a single one-time call: a **context manager** around a block, best when you want oneMKL for one section and stock NumPy elsewhere, or a **patch/restore pair**, best when oneMKL should stay active for the life of the process. That one call is the only addition. It redirects NumPy's internals so your existing `np.fft.*`, `np.random.*`, and `np.sin`/`np.exp`/`np.log` call sites dispatch to oneMKL with their source unchanged.

In multithreaded code, apply the patch before any threads start computing, or wrap all threads in the context manager. Patching while other threads are mid-computation is unsafe.

Concretely, given an existing function, the only edit is the import-and-activate block at the top. The function body is untouched:

```python
import numpy as np

# The only addition: import each extension and activate it once
import mkl_fft, mkl_umath
mkl_fft.patch_numpy_fft()
mkl_umath.patch_numpy_umath()

def analyze(signal):
    spectrum = np.fft.fft(signal)    # -> numpy.fft, then mkl_fft after activation
    power = np.abs(spectrum) ** 2    # -> oneMKL Vector Math (VM) after activation (large arrays)
    return np.log(power + 1.0)       # -> oneMKL Vector Math (VM) after activation (large arrays)

result = analyze(np.random.randn(1_000_000))  # same call, now backed by oneMKL
```

After the two `patch_*` calls, `np.fft.fft` and the ufuncs inside `analyze` dispatch to oneMKL; the function itself never changed. (`mkl_random` has the same `patch_numpy_random()` call, with the reproducibility caveat noted in its section below.) The per-lever benchmarks that follow wrap a block to make the before/after timing explicit in one script, but in real code the import plus one activation call is the whole change.

### Linear Algebra: BLAS and LAPACK

This is the lever you get for free. Once oneMKL is the backend, `np.dot`, `np.matmul`, `np.linalg.*`, and everything built on them (covariances, distances, decompositions) run on oneMKL's BLAS and LAPACK with no code change and nothing to activate. These kernels dispatch at runtime to an optimized code path for the CPU's instruction set (e.g., AVX-512 on current Xeons). This is the largest single contributor to the geomean speedup in [Benchmark results](#benchmark-results).

oneMKL parallelizes these calls across cores by default, so the main thing to manage is *how many* threads it uses, covered under [Threads and NUMA](#threads-and-numa).

### FFT: mkl_fft

`mkl_fft` is a Python interface to oneMKL's Fourier transform functions. It handles arbitrarily strided arrays (non-contiguous, negatively strided, multi-dimensional) directly, without first copying into a contiguous buffer, and covers real and complex data, single and double precision, and in-place and out-of-place transforms. It is worth switching on for any FFT-heavy workload.

The example below times the same `np.fft.fft2(a)` call twice. The call is identical in both runs; the only difference is that the second runs inside the context manager, which reroutes it to oneMKL:

```python
import timeit
import numpy as np
import mkl_fft

a = np.random.randn(4096, 4096)

stock_ms = timeit.timeit(lambda: np.fft.fft2(a), number=10) / 10 * 1000

with mkl_fft.mkl_fft():
    mkl_ms = timeit.timeit(lambda: np.fft.fft2(a), number=10) / 10 * 1000

print(f"stock numpy.fft : {stock_ms:.1f} ms")
print(f"mkl_fft         : {mkl_ms:.1f} ms")
print(f"speedup         : {stock_ms / mkl_ms:.1f}x")
```

To keep `mkl_fft` routing NumPy's FFT calls for the whole process rather than a single block, use the patch/restore pair (this affects the FFT functions only, not other NumPy operations):

```python
mkl_fft.patch_numpy_fft()
result = np.fft.rfft2(a)
mkl_fft.restore_numpy_fft()
```

For SciPy users there is a separate backend:

```python
import scipy.fft
import mkl_fft.interfaces.scipy_fft as mkl_scipy_fft

with scipy.fft.set_backend(mkl_scipy_fft):
    result = scipy.fft.fft2(a)
```

Covered transforms: `fft`, `ifft`, `fft2`, `ifft2`, `fftn`, `ifftn`, `rfft`, `irfft`, `rfft2`, `irfft2`, `rfftn`, `irfftn`, `hfft`, `ihfft`, `fftshift`, `ifftshift`, `fftfreq`, `rfftfreq`.

### Random Number Generation: mkl_random

`mkl_random` is a Python interface to oneMKL's Vector Statistics Library (VSL). It samples from the same distributions as `numpy.random` but is not a fixed-seed drop-in: the same seed produces a different sequence. It also uses lower-precision random values (32-bit) than NumPy (which uses 64-bit), so for work that needs high-precision randomness, stick with NumPy's `Generator`. Use it when generating large volumes of random data is a bottleneck and you do not depend on reproducing specific values.

It can be used two ways. The **context manager** is the zero-code-change path, like the other extensions: existing `np.random.*` call sites keep working and route through VSL (shown below). The **explicit `RandomState` API** is a small code change that lets you pick the generator and the sampling method for the fastest path. The benchmark below uses it with `method='BoxMuller'`, oneMKL's fast normal sampler.

_Note: the Box-Muller method, while faster, has different accuracy and granularity than the [ziggurat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_algorithm) method used by default by upstream NumPy, which might manifest when drawing very large quantities of random numbers. Be aware that it won't output absolute values larger than 6.6._

The example below compares wall time for 100 million normal samples against `np.random.default_rng`, NumPy's modern `Generator` API:

```python
import timeit
import numpy as np
import mkl_random

N = 100_000_000

rng_np = np.random.default_rng(0)
stock_ms = timeit.timeit(lambda: rng_np.standard_normal(N), number=5) / 5 * 1000

rng = mkl_random.RandomState(seed=0, brng='MT19937')
mkl_ms = timeit.timeit(lambda: rng.standard_normal(N, method='BoxMuller'), number=5) / 5 * 1000

print(f"numpy Generator : {stock_ms:.1f} ms")
print(f"mkl_random      : {mkl_ms:.1f} ms")
print(f"speedup         : {stock_ms / mkl_ms:.1f}x")
```

> **Reproducibility note:** `mkl_random` and `numpy.random` produce different sequences from the same seed. If your tests or simulations depend on specific random values, do not swap them.

`brng='MT19937'` selects the Mersenne Twister generator, matching `numpy.random`'s default algorithm. `mkl_random` offers two methods for normal sampling: [`'BoxMuller'`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform) (the faster one, used here) and [`'ICDF'`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling) (inverse-CDF, slower, maps each uniform to a normal one-to-one). Note that neither matches NumPy's own method: NumPy's `Generator` uses the [ziggurat algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_algorithm), which draws a variable number of random bits per sample, so the generated values differ from `mkl_random` regardless of method. For raw generation speed on `mkl_random`, keep `'BoxMuller'`.

If you do not need to choose the sampling method, the context manager is the zero-code-change path: existing `np.random.*` calls route through oneMKL VSL with their source untouched, exactly like `mkl_fft` and `mkl_umath`.

```python
with mkl_random.mkl_random():
    arr = np.random.standard_normal(1_000_000)  # backed by oneMKL VSL
```

For parallel Monte Carlo workloads, the `MT2203` family produces statistically independent streams per member ID. MT2203 is a set of 6,024 related generators (member IDs 0 through 6023); each ID selects a different one, so the streams it produces are independent by construction. Different seeds of a single generator are usually fine in practice but do not carry that documented guarantee. Each worker gets its own stream with no coordination or locking:

```python
import mkl_random

n_workers = 4
streams = [
    mkl_random.RandomState(seed=42, brng=("MT2203", i))
    for i in range(n_workers)
]

samples_per_worker = [s.standard_normal(1_000_000) for s in streams]
```

Alternatively, to partition a single generator instead of using the `MT2203` family, `skipahead(n)` advances a stream by `n` steps so each worker starts at a non-overlapping offset. The per-worker `block` must be at least the number of values each worker will draw, otherwise the blocks overlap; size it to your workload:

```python
block = 10_000_000
streams = [mkl_random.RandomState(seed=42) for _ in range(n_workers)]
for worker_id, stream in enumerate(streams):
    stream.skipahead(worker_id * block)  # each worker skips to its own block
```

`skipahead` takes a 64-bit offset, so keep `worker_id * block` within `int64` range (`worker_id * block <= np.iinfo(np.int64).max`); very large strides multiplied by the worker index will overflow.

### Vectorized Math: mkl_umath

`mkl_umath` swaps oneMKL's Vector Math (VM) loops in as the C-level inner loops of NumPy's ufuncs, so existing call sites get VM acceleration with no source change. It covers a broad set of element-wise functions, including the trigonometric and hyperbolic families, `exp`/`exp2`/`expm1`, `log`/`log2`/`log10`/`log1p`, `cbrt`, `sqrt`, and the basic arithmetic ufuncs. It is the lever for transcendental-heavy element-wise math.

VM takes over only above a per-operation minimum array size: roughly 8,192 elements for transcendentals (`sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `log`), 8,000 for `divide`, and 100,000 for `add`/`subtract`/`multiply` in `mkl_umath` 0.4.x. Below those sizes NumPy's native loops continue to run. These cutoffs are `mkl_umath` implementation details and can change between versions; the takeaway for tuning is that the extension helps most on large arrays.

```python
import timeit
import numpy as np
import mkl_umath

a = np.linspace(0.0, 2 * np.pi, 10_000_000)

stock_ms = timeit.timeit(lambda: np.sin(a) + np.exp(a) + np.log(np.abs(a) + 1), number=10) / 10 * 1000

with mkl_umath.mkl_umath():
    mkl_ms = timeit.timeit(lambda: np.sin(a) + np.exp(a) + np.log(np.abs(a) + 1), number=10) / 10 * 1000

print(f"stock numpy ufuncs : {stock_ms:.1f} ms")
print(f"mkl_umath          : {mkl_ms:.1f} ms")
print(f"speedup            : {stock_ms / mkl_ms:.1f}x")
```

To keep the patch active for the whole process, use the patch/restore pair:

```python
mkl_umath.patch_numpy_umath()
out = np.exp(a)
mkl_umath.restore_numpy_umath()
```

### Threads and NUMA

The levers above decide *which* code runs; this one decides how many cores it runs on, which on server-grade Xeon is often the difference between a good speedup and a great one. oneMKL parallelizes by default, so the goal is to match its thread count to the hardware and avoid over-subscription.

**Environment variables.** Set these in your shell before launching Python. They are read once when MKL and OpenMP first load, so exporting them after `import numpy` (or anything else that pulls in MKL) has no effect.

| Variable | Recommended value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| [`MKL_THREADING_LAYER`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-guide-linux/2026-0/dynamic-select-the-interface-and-threading-layer.html) | `INTEL` (recommended); ecosystem runtime otherwise | Select MKL's OpenMP runtime; see note below |
| [`MKL_NUM_THREADS`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-guide-linux/2026-0/onemkl-specific-env-vars-for-openmp-thread-ctrl.html) | physical core count | Cap MKL thread count |
| [`MKL_DYNAMIC`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-guide-linux/2026-0/mkl-dynamic.html) | `FALSE` (pair with `MKL_NUM_THREADS`; see note) | Disable automatic thread scaling |
| [`KMP_AFFINITY`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-cpp-compiler/developer-guide-reference/2025-0/thread-affinity-interface.html) | `granularity=fine,compact,1,0` | Pin threads to physical cores (Intel OpenMP only) |

`KMP_AFFINITY` is an Intel OpenMP setting, so it applies only when oneMKL is on the Intel runtime (`MKL_THREADING_LAYER=INTEL`). For a runtime-agnostic alternative that also works under LLVM and GNU, use the standard OpenMP controls `OMP_PROC_BIND=close` and `OMP_PLACES=cores`; `OMP_PLACES=cores` is what keeps threads off hyperthread siblings, which core-count alone does not guarantee. In `KMP_AFFINITY=granularity=fine,compact,1,0`, `granularity=fine` pins each thread to a single logical CPU, `compact` places threads on adjacent cores, and the trailing `1,0` are the permute and offset ([Intel reference](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-cpp-compiler/developer-guide-reference/2025-0/thread-affinity-interface.html)). This is appropriate for single-socket systems or when running one process per socket; on multi-socket systems without `numactl` it may bind threads across sockets. To see the actual binding at startup, prepend `verbose`: `KMP_AFFINITY=verbose,granularity=fine,compact,1,0`.

`MKL_DYNAMIC` [defaults to `TRUE`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-guide-linux/2026-0/mkl-dynamic.html), and while it is on, oneMKL scales the thread count down to the number of physical cores when a higher count is requested, which keeps work off hyperthread siblings automatically. Setting `MKL_DYNAMIC=FALSE` disables that scaling: with no explicit `MKL_NUM_THREADS`, oneMKL then defaults to *all logical processors*, including hyperthread siblings (on a 64-physical-core/128-thread machine, `mkl.get_max_threads()` reports 64 with `MKL_DYNAMIC=TRUE` but 128 with `FALSE`). So if you set `MKL_DYNAMIC=FALSE`, also set `MKL_NUM_THREADS` to the physical core count, and pin with `OMP_PLACES=cores` (or `numactl`) so threads land on distinct physical cores.

For workloads that spawn multiple Python processes, reduce oneMKL to one thread per process to avoid over-subscription:

```bash
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_THREADING_LAYER=SEQUENTIAL
```

This applies when multiple worker processes share one machine's cores: `multiprocessing.Pool`, `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`, and single-node Dask or Ray. Each worker initializes its own oneMKL thread pool; without capping, N workers × default thread count threads all compete for the same cores. scikit-learn's [parallelism guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/computing/parallelism.html) documents this nested-parallelism oversubscription for MKL, OpenBLAS, and BLIS under joblib.

`joblib`'s `loky` backend (its default, used by scikit-learn and similar libraries) handles this for you: it caps each worker's inner thread pool at `cpu_count() // n_jobs` automatically, so no manual capping is needed ([joblib docs](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parallel.html#avoiding-over-subscription-of-cpu-resources)). This inner-thread limiting is supported by backends that opt in via `supports_inner_max_num_threads` (loky does); other backends may not, so cap manually when using them. For thread-based parallelism (Python threads or free-threaded builds), where the import-time environment variables no longer help, use `mkl-service` below to change thread counts at runtime.

**Runtime control with mkl-service.** When environment variables are too coarse, `mkl-service` adjusts thread counts at runtime, including per domain:

```python
import mkl

print(mkl.get_version_string())               # confirm MKL version at runtime
print(mkl.get_max_threads())                  # current thread count

mkl.set_num_threads(8)                        # cap all MKL operations
mkl.domain_set_num_threads(1, domain="fft")   # cap FFT specifically
mkl.free_buffers()                            # return MKL scratch memory to OS
```

Valid domain values: `"blas"`, `"fft"`, `"vml"`, `"all"`. (`"pardiso"` is oneMKL's sparse direct solver, not used by NumPy directly.)

**NUMA pinning on multi-socket systems.** Keeping all oneMKL threads within one socket avoids inter-socket memory traffic. The benchmarks in [Benchmark results](#benchmark-results) show 3.95x geomean at one socket versus 3.66x across both on a 2-socket machine; that gap is NUMA overhead, not a compute limit.

Single process, one socket:

```bash
export MKL_THREADING_LAYER=INTEL   # see the OpenMP runtime note for when to use a different layer
numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 python your_script.py
```

`numactl --cpunodebind=0` already restricts the process to one socket's cores, so `MKL_NUM_THREADS` is optional here (set it only if you want fewer threads than the bound cores). `numactl` can also exclude hyperthread siblings from the CPU set with `--physcpubind`.

Two data-parallel processes, one per socket:

```bash
numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 python worker.py &
numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1 python worker.py &
```

**OpenMP runtime: which threading layer to choose.** oneMKL's threaded paths run on a threading layer selected by `MKL_THREADING_LAYER`. **For best performance on Intel hardware, use Intel OpenMP**, which is also oneMKL's default, so setting it explicitly guarantees it rather than changing behavior:

```bash
export MKL_THREADING_LAYER=INTEL
```

The variable accepts four values; pick by your environment:

| Value | Threading | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `INTEL` | Intel OpenMP (`libiomp5`) | Best oneMKL performance on Intel hardware. |
| `GNU` | GNU OpenMP (`libgomp`) | Your process already loads `libgomp` from other packages (for example scikit-learn, or other pip-installed scientific packages) |
| `TBB` | Intel TBB (no OpenMP) | Your stack is TBB-based. |
| `SEQUENTIAL` | single-threaded | You parallelize outside oneMKL (for example one worker process per core) and want each oneMKL instance to use one thread. |

Intel OpenMP is the fastest on Intel hardware; the others exist for compatibility with how the rest of your environment is threaded. The one situation to avoid is loading two OpenMP runtimes in the same process, for example oneMKL on Intel OpenMP (`libiomp5`) alongside a package that bundles GNU's `libgomp`. Two runtimes over-subscribe the cores. `MKL_THREADING_LAYER` controls oneMKL's runtime only; it does not stop another package from loading its own. When your environment already standardizes on one OpenMP runtime, match oneMKL to it:

- With LLVM's LibOMP present, use `MKL_THREADING_LAYER=INTEL`: oneMKL runs its Intel threading layer on LibOMP and the `KMP_*` controls apply.
- If other packages in the process pull in `libgomp` (some pip-installed scientific packages do), `MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU` selects oneMKL's GNU threading layer so the process shares a single runtime.

Platform defaults differ. On Linux, `_openmp_mutex` defaults to the GNU variant (pulled in by `libgcc`), so an environment with `mkl` from the **Intel channel** installs `libgomp` alongside `intel-openmp` regardless of which packages you add; both are then present on disk. (Installing `mkl` from **conda-forge** instead pins `_openmp_mutex` to the LLVM variant, so that stack resolves `llvm-openmp` rather than `libgomp`.) By itself this is harmless: with `MKL_THREADING_LAYER=INTEL` (or unset), oneMKL loads only Intel OpenMP (`libiomp5`), and `libgomp` sits unused.

It stops being harmless once something in the process actually loads `libgomp`. `intelpython3_full` bundles `scikit-learn`, which is built against GNU OpenMP: importing it alongside oneMKL loads both `libiomp5` and `libgomp` into the same process. If your environment imports `scikit-learn` or another GNU-OpenMP-linked package, set `MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU` so the process shares one runtime instead of running two. If you don't need those packages, install just `mkl`, the three extensions, and the BLAS selector (the [existing-environment command](#installation) above) instead of `intelpython3_full`; that avoids pulling in a GNU-OpenMP-linked package in the first place, keeping `INTEL` single-runtime with no tradeoff.

On Windows conda, NumPy/SciPy/MKL resolve `llvm-openmp`. To switch the conda OpenMP runtime to LLVM's LibOMP on Linux:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge _openmp_mutex=*=*_llvm
```

This install-time switch is Linux-only. Per the [conda-forge documentation](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#openmp), on Windows switching between OpenMP implementations is not supported: every package uses the implementation it was built against.

## Verifying oneMKL Is Active

Confirm oneMKL is actually the backend:

```python
from threadpoolctl import threadpool_info
import pprint
import numpy as np
pprint.pprint(threadpool_info())
```

Look for `"internal_api": "mkl"`:

```
[{'internal_api': 'mkl',
  'num_threads': 288,
  'threading_layer': 'intel',
  'user_api': 'blas', ...}]
```

The `threading_layer` value matches `MKL_THREADING_LAYER` (`gnu`, `intel`, `tbb` or `sequential`); the field that confirms the backend is `internal_api: mkl`.

`np.show_config()` reports the generic BLAS interface name (not "mkl") even with oneMKL active. That is expected: it reflects the interface NumPy compiled against, not the runtime library. `threadpoolctl` is the reliable check.

Confirm oneMKL is dispatching to hardware:

```bash
MKL_VERBOSE=1 python your_script.py 2>&1 | head -20
```

The output should include lines like:

```
MKL_VERBOSE Intel(R) oneAPI Math Kernel Library 2026.0 ...
MKL_VERBOSE DGEMM(N,N,4096,4096,4096,...) 2.1s CNT=1
```

Which of the `DGEMM`/`DFFT`/`VML` lines appear depends on what your code runs, a matrix multiply triggers `DGEMM`, an FFT triggers a transform entry, and so on. A quick way to force a `DGEMM` line is a single `np.matmul` on a large array (for example `np.random.rand(4096, 4096) @ np.random.rand(4096, 4096)`). If only the banner appears and no operation lines follow, oneMKL loaded but is not being called.

Confirm the explicit extensions are active (they report `False` until you patch them, which is the most common reason an expected FFT/random/math speedup does not show up):

```python
import mkl_fft, mkl_random, mkl_umath
print(mkl_fft.is_patched())    # True after patch_numpy_fft()
print(mkl_random.is_patched()) # True after patch_numpy_random()
print(mkl_umath.is_patched())  # True after patch_numpy_umath()
```

## Benchmark Results

The benchmarks are drawn from [npbench](https://github.com/spcl/npbench), an open-source suite of NumPy-heavy scientific workloads. The nine selected cover a representative mix: matrix and vector operations, Cholesky factorization, element-wise transcendentals, and reductions. Measured on Intel® Xeon® 6980P (Granite Rapids), 2 sockets, 128 physical cores per socket, hyperthreading on, SLES 15-SP7. Stock NumPy used OpenBLAS; Intel-optimized NumPy used oneMKL with all three extension patches active. Both ran the same conda-forge NumPy 2.4.3 binary. Results reflect the full setup: BLAS backend plus all three extension patches. Enabling only the BLAS backend without the extension patches produces lower speedups on benchmarks that exercise FFT, random, or transcendental math.

### Geomean Speedup By Thread Count

| Threads | Geomean speedup |
|---|---|
| **128** | **3.95x** |
| 256 | 3.66x |

T=128 fills one socket. T=256 crosses to the second socket, and the NUMA overhead pulls the average down.

### Per-Benchmark At T=128 (Intel® Xeon® 6980P)

| Benchmark | Stock NumPy (ms) | Intel NumPy (ms) | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| go_fast | 511 | 30 | **17.0x** |
| gesummv | 543 | 35 | **15.5x** |
| arc_distance | 445 | 67 | 6.6x |
| doitgen | 2,067 | 387 | 5.3x |
| cholesky2 | 1,556 | 430 | 3.6x |
| gemver | 515 | 262 | 2.0x |
| covariance | 1,104 | 689 | 1.6x |
| correlation | 1,141 | 735 | 1.6x |
| softmax | 774 | 553 | 1.4x |

At T=256, threads span both sockets and cross-socket memory traffic reduces speedups across the board. Keeping all threads within one socket (T=128 here) avoids that overhead, which is why the per-benchmark table uses T=128.

**Package versions used in these benchmarks:**

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| `numpy` | 2.4.3 |
| `mkl` | 2026.0.0 |
| `mkl_fft` | 2.2.0 |
| `mkl_random` | 1.4.0 |
| `mkl_umath` | 0.4.0 |

## Key Considerations

**The extension packages do not activate themselves.** `mkl_fft`, `mkl_random`, and `mkl_umath` do not replace NumPy functions on import. Use the patch function or context manager. Since the 2026.0 release installs the standard conda-forge NumPy rather than a bundled Intel build, there is no longer anything that activates them at build time, so explicit activation is required even in the full Intel® Distribution for Python.

**The activation model applies to versions starting with 2026.0.** The explicit `patch_*` workflow described here matches the package generation in [Benchmark results](#benchmark-results) (NumPy 2.4.3, mkl_fft 2.2.0, mkl_random 1.4.0, mkl_umath 0.4.0). Earlier releases up to 2025.3.0 (`intelpython3_full=2025.3.0`) behave differently:

- Prior releases install Intel's own NumPy build (2.3.2 from the Intel channel, not conda-forge) bundled with mkl_fft 2.1.2, mkl_random 1.3.1, and mkl_umath 0.3.1.
- FFT and vectorized math are activated **automatically at import**: `np.fft.fft` already dispatches to `mkl_fft`, and `mkl_umath.is_patched()` is `True` with no call. This automatic activation at import is exactly what the move to conda-forge NumPy in 2026.0 removed, making explicit activation necessary.
- The older extensions do **not** expose the `patch_numpy_fft`/`patch_numpy_umath`/`patch_numpy_random` functions used below. If you are on 2025.3.0 or earlier, do not add these calls; FFT and math are already active, and `mkl_random` never replaced `np.random`. Upgrade to the 2026.0 generation to use the explicit-activation workflow in this guide.

**`mkl_random` is not a drop-in for `numpy.random`.** The same seed produces a different sequence. Do not swap it into code that depends on reproducible random values.

**AMX does not apply to standard NumPy operations, even when using oneMKL.** NumPy's `float32` and `float64` operations use oneMKL's AVX-512 code paths. AMX tiles only activate for int8/bfloat16 GEMM, which NumPy does not call natively.
