# Intel Optimization Zone - Intel Tuning Guides

This repository contains a collection of Intel tuning guides and Intel optimization recipes specifically designed for Software, Workloads, Performance Analysis, Monitoring Tools, and Hardware optimal configurations. Our comprehensive resources include detailed configuration recommendations, performance tuning techniques, and best practices to help you unlock the full potential of your Intel Architecture.

## What You'll Find Here

### 💻 Software Tuning Guides

Comprehensive optimization tuning guides for various software including databases (i.e. Cassandra, MySQL, PostgreSQL), data processing frameworks (i.e. Spark, Gluten), and programming languages (i.e. Java), covering configuration tuning, memory management, and best practices for Intel architectures.

### 🔧 Workloads & Benchmarks

Industry-standard benchmark configurations and execution guides including enabling you to measure, validate, and compare your optimization results against established performance baselines.

### 📊 Performance Analysis & Monitoring Tools

Detailed guides for leveraging performance analysis and monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks, analyze system behavior, and optimize your workloads on Intel hardware.

### ⚙️ Intel Hardware Optimal Configurations

Best practices and configuration recommendations for getting the most out of your Intel architecture, including BIOS settings, CPU tuning, memory optimization, and system-level configurations to efficiency and performance.

### 🚀 Goal

We aim to provide a dynamic resource where users can find the latest optimization strategies, contribute feedback, and report issues.
